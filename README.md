   With the rapid development of informatization, information systems have been widely used in all walks of life. In particular, the rapid rise of artificial intelligence has continuously improved the intelligence level of information systems. In this process, information security is particularly critical, especially in industries involving sensitive data such as banking and government, where the digital security of information systems has become a top priority. Information systems generate a large number of behavioral log files during daily operation. The main function of the behavior log file is to record the system's operating status and key events, providing a basis for debugging system failures and root cause analysis. These behavior log data are not only an important source for understanding the health of the system, but also a key resource for identifying potential anomalies and ensuring system security. Through in-depth analysis of behavioral log data, abnormal behavior can be effectively identified and potential threats can be prevented in advance, thereby ensuring the organization's property security and the integrity of digital assets.
   Most of the sequence behavior log analysis and anomaly identification tools currently on the market are designed for specific systems, and the identification rules are usually only applicable to specific environments. These tools often require redesigning and adjusting analysis models for different systems and lack universality. Even for machine learning-based solutions, behavioral log data from different systems still need to be manually labeled, which increases the complexity and cost of operations and is difficult to be universally applicable to multiple systems.
   In response to this situation, the R&D team of this project proposed a digital security model based on deep learning. The model automatically mines the potential system behavior rules and operation logic by learning training data composed entirely of normal sequence behavior log data, thereby realizing the recognition of sequence behavior and intention of behavior logs. In addition, when it is impossible to obtain samples consisting entirely of normal log data, the model parameters can be adjusted to use mixed data consisting mainly of normal behavior sequence log data (where normal logs account for more than 90%) for model training. Compared with traditional methods, this model does not need to rely on manual labeling, has high intelligence and accuracy, has wide adaptability and versatility, and can provide efficient security protection for various information systems.
